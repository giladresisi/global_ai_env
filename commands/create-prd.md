# Create PRD: Generate Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) through strict context gathering, API research, and structured documentation. This command produces a production-ready PRD serving as the single source of truth for implementation.

**Output File**: `$ARGUMENTS` (default: `PRD.md` in project root)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

**DO NOT CREATE THE PRD UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTEXT**

**Workflow**:
1. **Discover** project type and scope through targeted questions
2. **Research** external APIs/SDKs if applicable (mandatory, not optional)
3. **Gather** all required information - ask questions until complete
4. **Confirm** with user before writing
5. **Write** PRD using appropriate template
6. **Backup** existing file if one exists

**Principles**:
- ❌ **No assumptions** - ask instead of guessing
- ❌ **No placeholder sections** - complete or explicitly skipped by user
- ✅ **Complete context first** - gather all info before writing
- ✅ **Research external dependencies** - understand APIs before documenting

---

## STEP 1: PROJECT TYPE & CONTEXT DISCOVERY

**Required Questions** - Ask the user:

1. **Project Type**: AI Agent / Web App / API/Service / Library/Package / CLI Tool / Desktop App / Mobile App / Other
2. **Core Functionality**: In 2-3 sentences, what does this product do?
3. **Target Users**: Who will use this? Technical level?
4. **MVP Scope**: What must be in first version vs. later?
5. **Technology Preferences**: Required/preferred technologies?
6. **External Dependencies**: External APIs, services, or SDKs?
7. **Deployment Context**: How deployed/distributed?
8. **Existing Documentation**: Related docs or research?

**Do not proceed without**:
- ✓ What you're building (type + core function)
- ✓ Who it's for (target users)
- ✓ What's in scope for MVP
- ✓ What external dependencies exist

---

## STEP 2: API RESEARCH (IF APPLICABLE)

**Mandatory if external APIs or unfamiliar SDKs involved.**

### Identify & Determine Research Needs

List all external APIs/SDKs, then **ask user for each**:
```
This project integrates with [API name].

Options:
1. Do you have existing research documents? (provide paths)
2. Should I research [API name] before creating PRD?
3. Skip research and document based on current knowledge (not recommended for unfamiliar APIs)

Your preference?
```

### Conduct Research

For each API requiring research:
1. **Execute**: `/core_piv_loop:explore-api [API name]`
2. **Read**: `.agent/research/[api]-research.md`
3. **Verify**: POC tests passed

**Do not proceed without**:
- ✓ User confirmation on research approach
- ✓ Completed API research (if chosen)
- ✓ Research documents read (if provided)

---

## STEP 3: GATHER COMPLETE REQUIREMENTS

### Information Gathering Strategy

For each template section:
1. Check conversation history for details
2. Ask specific questions for missing info
3. Confirm understanding before next section
4. Mark sections to skip (with explicit confirmation)
