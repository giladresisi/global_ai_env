# Cleanup Feature Progress

Clean up PROGRESS.md for a completed feature, leaving only essential completion information.

## Purpose

After a feature is fully complete, validated, and reviewed, consolidate all the detailed progress notes into a concise completion summary. This keeps PROGRESS.md maintainable while preserving critical information for future reference.

## Step 1: Read PROGRESS.md

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**

1. Read `PROGRESS.md`
2. Identify the feature section to clean up (usually the most recent one)
3. Extract key information:
   - What was the feature about
   - What tests passed
   - What manual tests weren't performed or didn't pass
   - How the core functionality was validated

## Step 2: Create Concise Completion Summary

Replace the entire feature section with a clean, concise summary:

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Completed**: [Date]
**Plan**: .agents/plans/[feature-name].md

### Core Validation
[1-2 sentence summary of how the core functionality was validated to be working correctly]

### Test Status
- Automated Tests: ✅ All passing ([X] unit, [Y] integration, [Z] e2e)
- Manual Tests: [Status]
  - ⚠️ Not performed: [list manual tests not done]
  - ❌ Failed: [list any failed manual tests]
  - ✅ Passed: [list passed manual tests if any were done]

### Notes
[Any important notes, gotchas, or follow-up items - keep brief]

---
```

## Step 3: Archive Detailed Information (Optional)

**If the detailed progress notes contain valuable information:**

1. Create `.agents/progress-archive/[feature-name]-progress.md`
2. Move the full detailed section there
3. Add reference in PROGRESS.md summary:
   ```markdown
   **Detailed Progress**: See .agents/progress-archive/[feature-name]-progress.md
   ```

**Only do this if the detailed notes are worth preserving for future reference.**

## Step 4: Update PROGRESS.md

Use Edit tool to replace the verbose feature section with the concise summary.

**Result:**
- PROGRESS.md is clean and scannable
- Essential completion info is preserved
- Future agents can quickly see what was done and what's left
- Detailed notes archived if valuable

## Guidelines

**Keep in summary:**
- ✅ Feature name and completion status
- ✅ Core validation approach (how it was verified to work)
- ✅ Test status (what passed, what didn't, what wasn't done)
- ✅ Critical notes or gotchas

**Remove from summary:**
- ❌ Detailed execution logs
- ❌ Step-by-step task descriptions
- ❌ Full execution reports
- ❌ Full system reviews
- ❌ Verbose divergence analysis

**Archive if valuable:**
- Detailed execution report with divergences
- System review findings
- Complex troubleshooting notes
- Important architectural decisions
