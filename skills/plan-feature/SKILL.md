# Plan a new task

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

**DO NOT EXECUTE THE PLAN AFTER CREATING IT.**

After the plan is created:
1. Show the user where the plan was saved
2. Tell them to run `/core_piv_loop:execute .agents/plans/[feature-name].md`
3. STOP

**Execution agent rules** (include verbatim in every generated plan):
- Make ALL code changes required by the plan
- Delete debug logs added during execution (keep pre-existing ones)
- Leave ALL changes UNSTAGED — do NOT run `git add` or `git commit`

**🚨 WRITE PLAN TO FILE ONLY — NEVER TO CLI 🚨**
- Write to `.agents/plans/[feature-name].md` using Write/Edit tool
- Do NOT output plan content in your response
- CLI output: summary only (2–3 sentences), questions, confirmation, final report

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 0: Log Planning Start

Before writing anything, **check if `PROGRESS.md` already has a relevant section for this feature** — especially if this skill was triggered by referencing something in `PROGRESS.md` (e.g. the user pointed at a section, or the feature description matches an existing entry).

**If a relevant section already exists:** update its top fields only (status, add Plan File line). Do NOT create a duplicate entry.

```markdown
**Status**: ✅ Planned
**Plan File**: .agents/plans/[feature-name].md
```

**If no relevant section exists:** add a new entry using the template below.

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]
### Planning Phase
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: [date]
**Plan File**: .agents/plans/[feature-name].md
```

Use Write if `PROGRESS.md` doesn't exist, Edit if it does.

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Feature Understanding

- Extract core problem, user value, feature type (New Capability/Enhancement/Refactor/Bug Fix), complexity
- Map affected systems
- Draft user story: As a / I want / So that

### Phase 2: Codebase Intelligence

**Check for similar features first.** If found, use AskUserQuestion before proceeding.

Check existing patterns for: integrations, endpoints, auth, schema, tools, UI components.

Gather in parallel:
1. Project structure, frameworks, service boundaries, config files
2. Naming conventions, error handling, logging patterns, CLAUDE.md
3. External libraries, docs/, ai_docs/, .agents/reference
4. Test framework, organization, coverage requirements
5. Integration points: routers, models, auth patterns

**Use AskUserQuestion if ANY of these exist:**
- Unclear, ambiguous, or contradictory requirements
- Multiple valid approaches without clear preference
- Conflicts between request and existing patterns
- Uncertainty about data models, schemas, or interfaces

Default to existing patterns. Document any divergences. Design for parallel execution.

### Phase 3: External Research

**APIs** (if applicable): Run `/core_piv_loop:explore-api [name]` for each.
Verify: features available, version compatible, rate limits sufficient, ToS permits use, auth accessible, no blockers.

**Dependencies**: Test in isolated venv first. Check conflict tree with `pipdeptree`/`npm list`. Document compatible versions and known conflicts.

**Technology**: Latest versions, official docs (with section anchors), common gotchas, breaking changes.

### Phase 4: Strategic Design

Think through:
- How does this fit existing architecture?
- Critical dependencies and order of operations?
- What could go wrong? (edge cases, race conditions, errors)
- Performance, security, maintainability implications?

### Phase 5: Write the Plan

Read `~/.claude/skills/plan-feature/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and use it as the structure for the output plan file, filling every section with feature-specific content.

**Output**: `.agents/plans/{kebab-case-name}.md`
**Length**: 500–700 lines — verify with `wc -l` and adjust

### Phase 6: Coverage Review Pass

Run automatically after plan is written. No user input needed unless a gap can't be resolved.

1. **Map new code paths** — for every file created/modified: functions, branches, async flows, error paths, API surface, data mutations
2. **Map project impact** — existing files that import/call changed code; existing tests that may need updating after the change
3. **Gap analysis** — for each path, verify a test in the plan covers it: ✅ Covered or ⚠️ Gap
4. **Fill gaps** — add automated test by default; if genuinely impossible to automate, add manual test with one-sentence justification ("requires physical hardware", "CAPTCHA blocks automation"). "Hard to automate" and "requires a browser" are NOT valid reasons — use Playwright.
5. **Re-verify** — repeat until all paths are ✅ or documented manual-only. Update Test Automation Summary in plan.

## Post-Planning Verification

```bash
test -f .agents/plans/[feature-name].md && echo "✅ Plan exists" || echo "❌ Missing"
wc -l .agents/plans/[feature-name].md
```

- [ ] Plan written to file (not CLI)
- [ ] File exists and is 500–700 lines
- [ ] Coverage Review Pass complete (Steps 1–5)
- [ ] All ambiguities resolved via AskUserQuestion
- [ ] Tasks in parallel execution waves with WAVE, DEPENDS_ON, AGENT_ROLE
- [ ] Interface contracts defined; 30%+ tasks parallelizable (or explain why not)
- [ ] Every test marked ✅/⚠️ with tool, file path, and run command
- [ ] Manual tests have automation-impossibility justification
- [ ] Test Automation Summary updated after gap-filling

## Final Report

Output to CLI after saving the plan. **Do NOT include plan content in this message.**

```

## Phase 7: Define Acceptance Criteria

After the Final Report has been output above (giving the user a chance to see the plan), invoke the `ai-dev-env:acceptance-criteria-define` skill if it is available in this system:

```
skill: "ai-dev-env:acceptance-criteria-define"
context: "<absolute path to the plan file just created>"
```

Pass the plan file path as the context. The skill will read the plan, derive proposed acceptance criteria, confirm them with the user, and write the agreed criteria into the plan file.

**If the `ai-dev-env:acceptance-criteria-define` skill is not available:** skip this phase and proceed directly to STOP below.

**Do NOT execute the plan after this phase completes.**

**STOP — DO NOT EXECUTE**
